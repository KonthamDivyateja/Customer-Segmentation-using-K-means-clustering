# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **customer segmentation** using the **Mall Customers dataset**.  
The goal is to understand customer behavior based on **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**, and to group customers into meaningful clusters using **K-Means Clustering**.

This type of analysis is widely used in **marketing and retail** to design targeted strategies for different customer segments.



##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about mall customers with the following attributes:

- **CustomerID** – Unique identifier (dropped during analysis)
- **Gender** – Male / Female
- **Age** – Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)** – Annual income in thousand dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)** – Score assigned based on customer behavior



##  Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (K-Means clustering)



##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analysis was performed:

- Checked dataset shape and data types
- Renamed incorrect column names
- Handled missing values
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Generated descriptive statistics
- Visualized:
  - Distribution of Age, Income, and Spending Score
  - Gender distribution
  - Violin plots by Gender
  - Age group distribution
  - Spending score distribution
  - Income distribution
  - Income vs Spending Score relationship



##  Data Visualization
Various plots were created to understand customer patterns:

- **Histograms & KDE plots** for numerical features
- **Count plots** for gender analysis
- **Violin plots** to compare distributions by gender
- **Bar plots** for age, income, and spending categories
- **Scatter plots** for income vs spending behavior



##  Clustering Approach
### K-Means Clustering
- Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Calculated **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)** for K values from 1 to 10
- Applied **K-Means clustering** on:
  - Age vs Spending Score
  - Annual Income vs Spending Score
  - All numerical features combined



##  Results
- Customers were successfully segmented into multiple clusters
- Each cluster represents a unique customer group with similar behavior
- Cluster centers were visualized to understand spending patterns
- Final clusters were visualized using:
  - 2D scatter plots
  - 3D plots (Age, Income, Spending Score)



##  Key Insights
- High-income customers do not always have high spending scores
- Younger customers show varied spending behavior
- Customer segmentation can help businesses:
  - Identify high-value customers
  - Design personalized marketing strategies
  - Improve customer retention
